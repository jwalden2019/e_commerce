## What is ArtMarket?

ArtMarket is an e-commerce web application made with the purpose of allowing users to buy and sell art without having to live in the same geographic location.

## Process

This is the first project I have made that uses Redux and so it was challenging implementing that technology into my workflow. I was able to make a rudimentary add to car feature but will need to flesh it out to make it professional grade. I primarily used vanilla CSS which was a lot of fun as I had greater freedom using that technology for creating a theme for ArtMarket.

The foundation technology for this project was React which is the best for building out web applications. It removes the clunky rendering of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript only combination and allows for a revolutionary step forward in terms of functionality and capability.
